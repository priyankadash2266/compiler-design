Q-Problem Statement – A stream of n data packets arrives at a server. This server can only process packets that are exactly 2^n units long for some non-negative integer value of n (0<=n).

All packets are repackaged in order to the 1 largest possible value of 2^n units. The remaining portion of the packet is added to the next arriving packet before it is repackaged. Find the size of the largest repackaged packet in the given stream.

Example :

arriving Packets = [12, 25, 10, 7, 8]
The first packet has 12 units. The maximum value of 2^n that can be made has 2^n = 2^3 = 8 units because the next size up is 2^n = 2^4 = 16 (16 is greater than 12).
12 – 8 = 4 units are added to the next packet. There are 4 + 25 = 29 units to repackage, 2^n = 2^4 = 16 is the new size leaving 9 units (29-16 = 9)
Next packet is 9 + 10 = 29 unists & the maximum units(in 2^n) is 16 leaving 3 units.
3 + 7 = 10 , the max units is 8 Leaving 2 units, and so on.
The maximum repackaged size is 16 units.
Returns:

Long : the size of the largest packet that is streamed
